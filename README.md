### Python DIC Software 

This is a Python implementation of digital image correlation functions which are still in beta status. Nevertheless you can already use the Python functions to analyse your set of images to calculate different kind of displacements and strains.
Functions can be use to filter and correlate images first before analysing results using a graphical user interface.
